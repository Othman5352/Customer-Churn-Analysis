• There were 7032 customers. 1869 churned. The churn rate was 26.58%.

• 13.35% and 13.23% of customers who left the company were women and men 
respectively.

• 19.81% of customers who left the company are not senior citizens. This shows that the 
churn rate is higher among the younger population.

• On partner analysis, 17.06% of those who left had no partners. Again, this can be 
attributed to the churn rate being higher among the younger customers.

• Of the customers who left, 21.94% had no dependents.

• 13.77% of customer churn were customers who had been with the company for less than 
10 months (new customers).

• The majority of customers who left the company were on the month-on-month contract 
type.

• Of the customers who left 15.23% used electronic check, 4.38% used mailed check, 
3.67% used bank transfer, 3.30% used credit card as payment method.

• 19.91% of customer churn were customers who had subscribed to paperless billing.

• The average monthly charges were highest for customers with the month-on-month 
contracts but their total charges yearly were much lower. On the other hand, the average 
monthly charges were lowest for customers with two year contracts but their total charges 
were much higher.

• Out of the customers who left, 13.38% had phone service and multiple lines and 13.37% 
had phone service but didn’t have multiple lines. They still left anyway. This suggests 
that multiple lines and phone service were not key influencers of customer churn.

• 24.94% of customers who had fiber optic and streamed movies left, 5.02% of those who 
had DSL and streamed movies left. This suggests that Fiber optic could be an issue and 
churn is likely to increase among the customers who have subscribed to it.

## Recommendations
• Pay close attention to new clients( less than 10 months). Offer them services that will 
hook them to the company so they stay with the company longer.

• Make one or two year contracts more attractive to customers compared to the month-to month contracts so that customers don’t find it fit to leave the company before the 
contract period is over. This will also make them stay longer increasing their tenure.

• Find innovative ways of providing customers with online security and boost their 
confidence in the systems and the company in general.

• Employ more tech staff to offer sufficient tech support to all clients.

• Provide customers with diversified internet services so they have options other than fiber 
optic and DSL
